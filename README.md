Conclusion:
->Serial time is short for small problems because multithreading overhead takes more time.
->Multithreading takes less time for relative large problem/task as seen above from 10000 onwards.
->ThreadPool class is designed for short-lived tasks, and it may not be suitable for long-running or resource-intensive tasks. In these cases, you may want to consider using the Task or Thread classes instead.
